# Enlil - Enlil's Not Life In Lisp
This is my [Lisp In Summer Projects](http://lispinsummerprojects.org/) project.

The goal is to do an [Artifical Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life) simulation of some sort in the browser, using Clojure and Clojurescript.

## Who is [Enlil](http://thishollowearth.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/god-of-the-week-enlil/)?
![enlil](http://thishollowearth.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/enlil.jpg?w=212&h=300)

It is named after/for the chief god of several mesopotamian cultures, I had NLIL when I started looking for a [recursive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) [backronym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym) so the name suggested itself.

> at thy name, which created the world, the heavens were hushed of themselves.
